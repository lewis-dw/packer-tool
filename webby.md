# Updates from webby

## Royal mail to be fully integrated
This is an intended update, the same as dpd etc

## Box size and weights to default accordingly ie. mug would be 16x16x16 @ 1kg, a steering wheel would be 41x41x13 @ 2kg. we often use only about 3 different size boxes for most things.
X

## States to be input automatically for the US
This is implemented in the new version, where it fails to automatically find it will still prompt user

## Regions for areas that it requires being input automatically
X

## Countries that do not accept electronic invoices are unable to process
This is no longer an issue - I have added a button to include/remove ETD
I will also set the button on or off automatically based on the shipping country id

## Having to correct text in files if there is an issue.
This will no longer be an issue due to the programs being combined

## No need to have a final acceptance "ok" button once we have completed the ship.
Will not be in new version

## The only notifications required are, if there is an issue and why, if the cost seems extreme compared to the price paid, if there is a size issue and if there is missing data somewhere
X

## If we can do a manual ship and be able to attach the documents and choose ourselves to pay the customs and import if necessary would be ace
Adding in a manual ship creation page which will pass the data to the display order page to ship

## A button which takes you directly to FEDEX, UPS and google maps (to help with address searches etc.)
I intend to implement something like this with google maps to display the address on the 'display order info' screen


### Problems solved by the report system
You may have noticed some of the issues have just been moved here it is because the report ticket system will allow the problems to get fixed overtime.
- Weights and dimensions to be updated
- Commodity codes to be up to date ie. mug is 69111000 <- chatgpt it
- Country of manufacture to be up to date and in the correct for ie. BD for Bangladesh and clothing
