plan of action

pull the 'all orders' into a refreshable saved list of orders to do and mark if being completed by someone or done etc

allow user to click an order which will call the api method to get all the data related and populate the 'currently editing' data bit (not decided data format)

allow option to :
    - edit person info
    - edit package info
    - quote it
    - ship it

finally need a history pull
